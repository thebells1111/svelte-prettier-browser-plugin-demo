# I want Prettier... for Svelte... in the Browser!!!

That's what I'm working on with this. You can help.

Maybe some testing. I don't know anything about testing.

I'm muddling through making this work with `prettier/standalone.js`.

I'm not quite sure how all of this `AST` stuff works. Maybe you know, and can help make this thing super awesome.
